# collatz-reverse
an attempt at reversing the collatz conjecture (for funsies)

what it actually does:
if every number through the collatz conjecture goes to 1, then theoretically every number is accessible from 1 when reversing the logic of the collatz conjecture

unlike collatz which is (relatively) straightforward, it is possible to enter into an infinite loop in reverse collatz.

what you actually do by learning this:
you learn the concept of prime number jumping, similar to the sieve of erastothenes
